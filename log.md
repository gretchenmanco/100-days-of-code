### Day 1:  January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-1-github-startup-4846d6367015#.r778all04

**Thoughts:** I am ironing out wrinkles in my understanding of GitHub's push/pull system, but I am slowly getting it.  Need to find someone with whom to practice.

**Link to work:**  No separate code examples today (tutorials from Git and CodeSchool).



### Day 2:  January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-2-hanging-on-to-github-281c1dc7ba46#.rb62be6yh

**Thoughts:**  Encountering some resistance with pushing my commits.  Will consider doing the CodeSchool "Git Real" course to improve my understanding and ability to use Git on an every day basis.

**Link to work:** No separate code examples today (tutorials from Git and CodeSchool).



### Day 3:  January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com: **  https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-3-markdown-more-github-d5d489ddf46d#.o5f1zo639

**Progress:** Played around with Markdown while I was working on the Spoon-Knife demo and this coding log.

**Thoughts:** Slow day with reading of documentation and working inside GitHub.  I will reach out to someone locally who can work with me in Git so that I can practice some techniques.

**Link to work:** No separate code examples today as I worked on closing and pulling/pushing on GitHub.



### Day 4:  January 6 and 7, 2017  (Started late on Friday, January 6th and just continued through the 7th-counting only as one day, though overlapped two calendar days)

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-4-reach-out-to-make-progress-c4e8c3a0d9c#.ceob2bt5t

**Thoughts:** Finalized some arrangements for GitHub practice with a friend, and I'm looking forward to that happening.  I continued my FreeCodeCamp journey by finishing a few lessons, including picking up a few new ones, and I have begun the 'Basic Front End Development Projects' section of FCC.  Last year I ploughed ahead to working in JavaScript, but I've decided to complete the curriculum in sequential order hence the return to the Basic Front End Dev Projects.  The next step is to get set up in CodePen and then I should be ready to compose the tribute page project.

### Day 5:  January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-5-give-and-git-237cef9daf6b#.d4ykgew05

**Thoughts:** Today was a great day!  I was offered the opportunity to work with someone using GitHub, and did I ever accept that offer!  After an initial explanation of the different Git tools, and some examples of the power of Git, we then discussed workflows, code management, and a little bit about the relevant team management required as teams increase in their size. We then discussed the management principles of discipline and responsbility (for individuals and for teams).   The point was repeatedly made that Git is a set of tools, and that <i>how</i> Git is utilized resides with the individual user (or project manager) to discern according to the needs of a project or an organization.  Below are the links to the two suggested Git-related tools.

Using screen-sharing in a Google hangout, in conjunction with live file-changes in Git, I began to have a better understanding of the locations where the code is living at any point in time.  Just by this one discussion today I have such a clearer view of the ability of Git to track and manage code, and similar items.  I will be exploring Git throughout this Coding Challenge, and I am really honored and humbled that this person took the time on a Sunday afternoon to share knowledge.  As a means of thanks, I will be sharing this new-found knowledge with at least two other freeCodeCampers who are working with Git, and I have begun to contemplate how I can coordinate a GitHub tutorial for the local freeCodeCamp meetup.

Here's the other lesson beyond learning Git:  "Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened."  This is an ancient proverb that is still standing the test of time.  Wherein is the rub, the difficulty?  In having the courage to ask, to seek, and to knock; and, perhaps, in having to ask more than one person.  In other words, do not give up.  In other words, be vulnerable to ask, persistent to seek, and finally courageous to step through the opened door.

**From Medium:**  "Day 5 of this 100-day Coding Challenge was a great day! I learned all about Git-ing — and Giving. I am becoming more convinced that my daily lessons in programming are really just vehicles for life’s reminders, for life’s lessons.
The remainder of Day 5’s log: tl:dr…
Ostensibly the lesson I learned today regarded the use of GitHub. After Day 4’s post regarding courage to ask for help, I received a note from someone I knew via CodeNewbie (an amazing community of programmers on Twitter started by Saron Yitbarek) inquiring if I would like an additional explanation of GitHub? I answered ‘yes’ so fast, I’m surprised I did not flub my reply.
Approximately 24 hours later, we had a Google hangout up and running, and I was so happy to be talking shop with someone. Talking shop is vitally important during the days when learning something is a struggle, and this is the reason why I constantly refer people to the #CodeNewbie Twitter-chat on Wednesdays at 9 pm and to the Free Code Camp forums. Find your people, and talk shop with them. The stories you read and hear will sustain you during the hours of frustration, disappointment, even failure.
We dove right into the lesson by way of an overview of Git tools, and followed that with examples of the power of Git. We then discussed workflows, code management, and the relevant team-management tools required as teams increase in their size. From there, we moved to a discussion of the management principles of discipline and responsibility (for individuals and for teams). The point was repeatedly made that Git is a set of tools, and that how Git is utilized resides with the individual user (or project manager) to discern and decide according to the needs of a project, team, or an organization.
Two Git-related tools were suggested and I share them now: Kdiff3 and TortoiseGit.

Kdiff3 is a diff & merge program with many other utilities.
kdiff3.sourceforge.net

TortoiseGit is a Windows shell, and basically offers overlay functionality.
TortoiseGit - Windows Shell Interface to Git

TortoiseGit provides overlay icons showing the file status, a powerful context menu for Git and much more!
tortoisegit.org

We worked through different repositories in which each of us played different roles. The role one plays in a GitHub repository impacts one’s scope of authority on a collaborative project. From this one discussion, I have obtained a clearer view of what Git is, how I will be able track and manage code, and how I can better collaborate. I will continue exploring Git throughout this #100DaysofCode Challenge, and I am really honored and humbled that this person took the time on a Sunday afternoon to share this knowledge. As a means of thanks, I will be sharing this new-to-me knowledge with at least two other local freeCodeCampers who are working with Git.
Here’s the other lesson beyond learning Git: “Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened.” This is an ancient proverb that is still standing the test of time. Wherein is the rub, the difficulty? In having the courage to ask, to seek, and to knock. In other words, in not giving up.
Thank you for all of your encouragement. Best wishes on your goals!

### Day 6:  January 12 - 13, 2017  (Started late on Thursday, January 12th and just continued through the 13th-counting only as one day, though overlapped two calendar days)

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: 

**Thoughts:** Both the laptop & tablet are out of commission for a few days.  I read some more Git documentation yesterday, and I have been reading quite a few blogs and updates from others participating in this challenge.  This is such an encouraging community.  Remember how people are helping to create this community of encouragement!  

I took off a few days from programming because of the absent laptop and my new job.  

Tonight I attempted to work on GitHub and FreeCodeCamp from my iPhone, with limited success, and have borrowed a laptop to continue to work on some things in GitHub tonight.  Overall, a low-key, but happy week. 

_later in the evening, after midnight, so now January 13th_:  I've been working with C's repo and trying to understand the many, many nuances of GitHub. The impression I have as of this moment is that there are many ways for me to save my work, but only one way to have it merged with the original repo _if_ I'm not the owner of the destination-repo.  In other words, I cannot break someone else's program by mistake or intention using GitHub _so long as_ I am not a co-owner on that repo, or possibly a collaborator.

_A little bit later on the 13th_:  This is really cool how this system works!  AS a Collaborator on a project, however, there could be the chace to really mess up the program.  _TRUST is going to be vitally important among Collaborators._    This may be the lesson for yesterday and today's work in GitHub.

_And even a little later still_:  I joined GitHub in 2014.  3 years to the date I really begin using this amazing set of tools.  _Why did I ever delay!????!!_  So glad to be here.

Other Activity:  

1.  I learned how to delete individual files and delete entire repositories, so I removed a couple of repos.
2.  I also created and deleted a pull request to Kallaway in order to practice that on another repo.
3.  As a Collaborator on one of C's repos, I created a wiki for that project (_i.e._, repo) and I created a pull request back to the original repo which happened to be my repo.  I then merged the pull request and can see in my repo (the master repo) the file that C created a few days ago.

### Day 7:  January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: 

**Thoughts:** Today was the date for the local freeCodeCamp meetup, and we had a good time!  The continued problem we have at the meetup venues is the lack of inconsistent wi-fi service.  We have chosen our current venue (a new Starbucks) especially because they offer three different networks for customers; however, today, all three networks had insufficient wifi.  I'll be contacting the IT personnel to inquire as to whether we had some errors in our usage process or whether the problem was an anomaly.  It is difficult to keep up one's spirit when the wifi is down and one is counting on said wifi to complete lessons and work in freeCodeCamp.org and github.com (respectively).  We press on nevertheless!

As for my activity, it focused primarily in three areas:  (1) GitHub--I shared my budding GitHub knowledge with a colleague from freeCodeCamp.com  We practiced changing files, committing, commenting, closing and merging pullRequests, et c.  I also created a branch from the master of one of my files in one of my repo's and explored how changes in the branch occured and how to make it become even with the master of that particular file.  (2) Google Hangouts:  We practiced working on a repo as if we were consulting via Google Hangouts.

### Day 8:  February 22, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **:  Today's log will not be published on Medium as this is a catch-up entry.

**Thoughts** I began classes a few days after day 7 (above), and all non-course-related coding essentially ground to a halt.
I had great hopes that this cessation would not occur, nevertheless, it did.  I really want to get through the freeCodeCamp certification, and since my last entry I have decided NOT to take any university courses this Summer in order to focus on my coding with freeCodeCamp.  In particular, my goal is to complete the Full Stack Certification.

I have been coding since Day 7, but I did not log that coding experience in here as I had planned to use this log only for FCC-related coding.  Since very little coding with JavaScript is occuring, then I have decided to record whatever type of programming I happen to be doing, whether for FCC or for my Engineering classes.  

My current programming efforts are primarily focused on learning Assembly Language, and I'm programming one of MicroChip's PIC's (8-bit).  I have not programmed with AL enough to decide whether or not I "like" programming with AL, but I still find it interesting.  Another benefit to taking this course in MicroProcessors is that I am revisiting basics in number systems, digital logic gates, registers, counters, and how to encode/decode.  This second aspect, i.e., the review of this computer information, has been surprisingly very interesting to me.  I do not recall being so interested in these details the first time I was exposed to them.  

One more thing I am doing is setting a once-a-week time to informally meetup with anyone from my local freeCodeCamp group.  The goal of this group is to have fun while holding ourselves ever so slightly more accountable to our coding goals for 2017.  These meetups are one of my favorite events every week.

Key lesson for today (and everyday):  "Never, never, never give up." quote from PM Winston Churchill.  

Thankful for...the many people I have met who are so encouraging to me.  I cannot repay them, but I can by grace pay forward their support and encouragement by being an equally supportive and encouraging person to others.

Enough for this catch-up log.  

OTHER:  Thinking I might re-arrange this log so that the most recent entry is always on top.
